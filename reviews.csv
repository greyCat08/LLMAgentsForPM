"Calm has great stories, meditations and more. I love it and have the full version ... Please add more voices like Eduardo Ballerini, Ramon Tikaram, Chiké Okonkwo."
"The Calm app was disappointing at best. The app is clunky and they are forever asking you to recommend the app to a friend (not very calming)."
"Signed up for a free trial ... cancelled subscription ... Apple was able to see where I was on for a"
"I would give this thieving company zero stars ... it never worked and kept asking me to pay for a subscription."
"I didn’t accept the trial but 3 months later I had a $48.99 charge ... Calm didn’t help."
"Content is fine but admin processes show that it is clearly a rip‑off ... no simple way to cancel"
"Good content ... but app navigation is difficult and interface changes too often."
"Cancelled trial in August and they charged my card in November — horrible business practice."
"Love Calm, slept better since listening to the sleep stories."
"I love the background sound even without subscription — truly calmed me lol"
